	<EducationSubTitle>Menopausal Cognitive Changes</EducationSubTitle>
	<Paragraph>
		<b>Depression is a common condition that affects women more than men.</b> Mood can be affected
		by many factors, including changes in hormones associated with menopause, menopausal symptoms,
		sleep disturbance, and chronic medical conditions.
		<b>Depressive symptoms can increase in the menopausal transition.</b>
		Women who have a history of depression, major depressive episodes, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and
		postpartum depression may be at higher risk of having these symptoms occur.
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		<b>
			The menopausal transition can also be a time where women are at risk of developing anxiety,
			either new onset, or recurrent.
		</b>
		This can also be associated with the frequency and intensity of vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes
		and night sweats.

		<Paragraph>
			Antidepressants and cognitive behavioural therapy are first line treatments for depressive
			disorders and depressive symptoms for menopausal women. It is important to determine whether
			mood changes started at the time of menopause, or are pre-existing. For women who are already
			taking an antidepressant medication, some dose changes may be required around the time of
			menopause to improve mood. Some women will have mood benefits from menopausal hormone therapy,
			especially women in perimenopause. For women experiencing both VMS and mood symptoms, MHT can
			be helpful. There is also evidence for regular exercise and mindfulness-based therapies to
			improve mood.
