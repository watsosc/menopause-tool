		<b>
			The most common sexual issues associated with menopause are loss of libido (sex drive) and
			pain with sex (dyspareunia).
		</b>
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		<b>Up to 50% of women report low sex drive.</b> This can occur before the last menstrual period.
		There are many factors that can affect sex drive, including menopause. Many other factors affect
		libido:
		<ol class="ml-6 list-disc">
			<li>Stress</li>
			<li>Body Image</li>
			<li>Past sexual experiences</li>
			<li>
				Partner factors such as lack of a partner, partner’s health and partner’s own sexual
				function
			</li>
			<li>
				Medication and Drugs including opioids, antidepressants, chemotherapy, antihistamines,
				alcohol and recreational drugs.
			</li>
			<li>
				Personal health and medical issues such as anxiety, depression, urinary incontinence,
				thyroid problems, cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
			</li>
		</ol>
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		<b>
			The vulvar and vaginal changes associated with the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)
			can also affect desire, and cause discomfort or pain with sex.
		</b>
		This can affect arousal and orgasm.
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		Sexual problems can be more common in women who undergo surgical menopause, or who undergo early
		menopause (before the age of 45).
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		<b>
			Sexual function is multifactorial, and there is no “normal”. Any sexual issue that causes you
			distress is worth speaking to your health care provider about.
		</b>

	<SubSection title="Improving Sexual Function">
		<Paragraph>
			<b>Sexual function and libido are multifactorial</b>, meaning lots of factors can have an
			impact. Proper treatment of sexual function and libido requires education about the effects of
			aging, health and medications.
		</Paragraph>
		<Paragraph>
			<b>Treatment of Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause</b> should be considered, and strategies for
			improving relationships and communication with partners could be discussed. Sometimes a sexual
			health counsellor can help with these issues. Other health conditions, such as anxiety, depression,
			urinary incontinence, thyroid problems, cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes should be optimized.
		</Paragraph>
		<Paragraph>
			<b>Pain with sex</b> can be helped with lubricants, vaginal moisturizers and local estrogen
			therapy, as well as pelvic floor physiotherapy. Lubricants can be bought over the counter, as
			can vaginal moisturizers (brand names include
			<b><i>Replens, Repagyn, Gynatrof and Zestica</i></b>). Vaginal estrogen therapy can be
			delivered as a cream (Brand names: <b><i>Estragyn</i></b> or <b><i>Premarin</i></b>), a
			vaginal suppository (Brand name: <b><i>Vagifem</i></b>), or a ring (Brand name:
			<b><i>Estring</i></b>).
		</Paragraph>
		<Paragraph>
			<b>Low sex drive</b> can sometimes be treated with topical testosterone therapy.
			<b>This is considered “off label” use in Canada</b>, although topical testosterone is approved
			for use by women for this indication in many other countries. Testosterone use requires
			frequent blood tests to monitor blood levels. Less than 5 % of women will have a mild increase
			in acne and facial hair associated with testosterone use. Speak to your doctor about whether
			topical testosterone therapy could be considered for you.
